# High-Performance Parallel Programming with Intel oneAPI

Intel oneAPI is a unified, cross-architecture programming model that offers a comprehensive and powerful set of tools and technologies to simplify parallel programming across various devices (CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc.). In this article, we focus on parallel programming with Intel® oneAPI DPC++ (Data Parallel C++) and demonstrate how it simplifies the creation of high-performance parallel programs.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Before we start, we'll set up the development environment on the Intel DevCloud. Intel DevCloud is a free development platform that comes preloaded with the oneAPI Base Toolkit, allowing for cloud-based development and testing.

After registering and logging into Intel DevCloud, you can access and use the development environment provided directly in your browser.

## Parallel Programming with Intel® oneAPI DPC++

Intel® oneAPI Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) is a core component of the oneAPI toolkit. It's a high-performance programming language based on modern C++. DPC++ provides a simple, straightforward programming model that makes parallel programming across different hardware platforms easier.

Let's understand the use of DPC++ through a simple example. In this example, we will implement a simple matrix multiplication.

First, we need to load the DPC++ compiler:

```bash
source /opt/intel/inteloneapi/setvars.sh
```

Then, we can create a new DPC++ source file as shown below:

```cpp
#include <CL/sycl.hpp>

using namespace sycl;

int main() {
    queue q;

    const int M = 1024;
    const int N = 1024;
    const int K = 1024;

    float* A = malloc_shared<float>(M * K, q);
    float* B = malloc_shared<float>(K * N, q);
    float* C = malloc_shared<float>(M * N, q);

    // Initialize matrices A and B
    for (int i = 0; i < M * K; i++) A[i] = rand() / (float)RAND_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < K * N; i++) B[i] = rand() / (float)RAND_MAX;

    q.parallel_for(range<2>{M, N}, [=](id<2> idx) {
        int i = idx[0];
        int j = idx[1];
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < K; k++) {
            sum += A[i * K + k] * B[k * N + j];
        }
        C[i * N + j] = sum;
    }).wait();

    // Check results
    // ...

    free(A, q);
    free(B, q);
    free(C, q);

    return 0;
}
```

This program first creates a DPC++ queue `q`, then allocates three matrices A, B, and C in shared memory using the `malloc_shared` function. It then uses a parallel for loop (`parallel_for`) to compute the matrix multiplication, and finally releases the allocated memory.

This example showcases the main advantages of DPC++: its concise syntax makes parallel programming more direct and simple, while ensuring high performance and cross-platform compatibility.

## Conclusion

By using Intel oneAPI and DPC++, developers can easily write high-performance parallel programs without worrying about the specifics of the underlying hardware. This greatly enhances development efficiency while ensuring the performance and portability of programs. These reflect the powerful capabilities and huge potential of Intel oneAPI in the field of parallel and heterogeneous computing.
